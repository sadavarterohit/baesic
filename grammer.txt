Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT

but here, you cannot have negative numbers,

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  

now, we don't have support for left and right parenthesis changing the priority of operation

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN

To add powers, now we need to make this change below

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  POWER
POWER       ->  ATOM (POW FACTOR*)            
ATOM        ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN

We may need VAR a = ...
and also to use the identifier wherever we want
So, we add the = identifier

Expression  ->  KEYWORD:VAR IDENTIFIER EQ Expression
            ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  POWER
POWER       ->  ATOM (POW FACTOR*)            
ATOM        ->  INT|FLOAT|IDENTIFIER
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN
