Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT

but here, you cannot have negative numbers,

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  

now, we don't have support for left and right parenthesis changing the priority of operation

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN
