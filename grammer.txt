Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT

but here, you cannot have negative numbers,

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  

now, we don't have support for left and right parenthesis changing the priority of operation

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN

To add powers, now we need to make this change below

Expression  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  POWER
POWER       ->  ATOM (POW FACTOR*)            
ATOM        ->  INT|FLOAT
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN

We may need VAR a = ...
and also to use the identifier wherever we want
So, we add the = identifier

Expression  ->  KEYWORD:VAR IDENTIFIER EQ Expression
            ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  POWER
POWER       ->  ATOM (POW FACTOR*)            
ATOM        ->  INT|FLOAT|IDENTIFIER
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN

Now we need to add the comparison operators
like 5+5 == 2+8 
so, comparison has to take lesser priority than expression, 
but at the same time, VAR a = 5==5 should have higher priority for 5==5, so we gotta put it in between

Expression  ->  KEYWORD:VAR IDENTIFIER EQ Expression
            ->  comp_expr ((KEYWORD:AND)|KEYWORD:OR)comp_expr)*
comp_expr   ->  (KEYWORD:NOT) comparison  
            ->  Arithmetic ((EE|LT|GT|LTE|GTE) Arithmetic)*
Arithmetic  ->  TERM ((PLUS|MINUS)TERM)*
TERM        ->  FACTOR ((MULTIPLY/DIVIDE)FACTOR)*
FACTOR      ->  (PLUS|MINUS) FACTOR  
            ->  POWER
POWER       ->  ATOM (POW FACTOR*)            
ATOM        ->  INT|FLOAT|IDENTIFIER
            ->  LPAREN expr RPAREN
